I can help you do the same.",

Instead of handing me pain pills or expensive supplements I can expect to take for the rest of my life, Dr. Morse's is in the business of healing people, including with fibromyalgia. The perscription? A mostly fresh fruit diet and herbs to stimulate the organs, especially the lymph system. I'm working with his clinic right now, and so far, the diet has me feeling better than I have in many years.",

Our current conventional healthcare system often falls short of finding the root causes of symptoms and silent inflammation, leaving patients with a prescription and not much else. Rather than simply masking symptoms, our practitioners use science based labs and in depth patient health discovery to do a deep dive into what may be triggering a cascade of inflammation in the patient. While many patients may be used to a quick 15 minute meeting with their doctor, our practitioners spend an entire 90 minutes during your initial consultation in order to cover all potential factors.",
