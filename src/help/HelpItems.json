	  "description": "Root Causes Clinic was created to offer a wider range of Functional Medicine Practitioners to people like you. Our current conventional healthcare system often falls short of finding the root causes of symptoms and silent inflammation, leaving patients with a prescription and not much else. Rather than simply masking symptoms, our practitioners use science based labs and in depth patient health discovery to do a deep dive into what may be triggering a cascade of inflammation in the patient. While many patients may be used to a quick 15 minute meeting with their doctor, our practitioners spend an entire 90 minutes during your initial consultation in order to cover all potential factors.",
