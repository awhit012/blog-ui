Instead of handing me pain pills or expensive supplements I can expect to take for the rest of my life, Dr. Morse's is in the business of healing people, including with fibromyalgia. The perscription? A mostly fresh fruit diet and herbs to stimulate the organs, especially the lymph system. I'm working with his clinic right now, and so far, the diet has me feeling better than I have in many years.",
